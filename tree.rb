  def insert(value)
=begin
  It is very similar to the search function.
  You again start at the root of the tree and go down recursively,
  searching for the right place to insert our new node,
  in the same way as explained in the search function.
  Make sure to check for duplicates and omit if so.

=end
  end

  def delete(value)
=begin
  1. No subtree (no children): This one is the easiest one.
  You can simply just delete the node, without any additional actions required.
  2. One subtree (one child): You have to make sure that after the node is deleted,
  its child is then connected to the deleted node’s parent.
  3. Two subtrees (two children): You have to find and replace the node you want to delete,
  with its successor (the letfmost node in the right subtree).
