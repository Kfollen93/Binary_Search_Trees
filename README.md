# Binary Search Tree

## Functionality

- On instantiation of Tree class, build_tree creates a balanced binary search tree from an ordered array.
- Duplicate values are not allowed; they will be removed during instantiation and insert will not accept them.
- Basic operations: insert, delete, find.
- Traversals: level_order, preorder, inorder, postorder.
- Other methods: balanced?, rebalance, height.
